Included in a [subfolder](fizzbuzz/) is a broken, poorly written React implementation of [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).

1. Make it work (see the Wikipedia link above).
2. Clean up the code - demonstrate how you write React.
3. Add some test coverage to prevent regressions (the project already has Jest).
4. Do the above knowing that additional requirements will be added later.
